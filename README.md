This is my final project for my Front End Development 2 course. We were tasked to create an informaitonal website on a JavaScript library/framework of our choosing. My team and I decided to do GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). Here you will find the code to our final project. We incoroporated Bootstrap into our project as well to assist with responsiveness, carousels, and modals. 

Enjoy!
